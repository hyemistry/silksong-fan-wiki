        <p>Tutorial boss; the mother of all creatures (and also the largest) in Moss Grotto. Once the Needolin is acquired, two Moss Mothers can be fought in the Weavenest Atla. <br><br> If the player reaches Act 3, they can fight a void-possessed version of her in Moss Grotto.</p>

        <p>A beast first found stuck in the silk threads of The Marrow. At first, she is hostile—once Hornet knocks some sense into her, she becomes both a companion and the counterpart of Hollow Knight’s transportation Stags.</p>

        <p>A vicious bird-like bug, Moorwing tends to feast on pilgrims to pass on Bellhart. The editor, in fact, died more times to this boss than she did on Grand Mother Silk. <br><br>Moorwing's fight can be skipped if the "The Lost Fleas" wish had been granted, which makes the Flea Caravan move to its arena. If this happens, Moorwing can instead be fought in Act 2 right next to the Greymoor Bellway.</p>

        <p>A Weaver who had her mask taken and has two pins lodged through her spine, rendering her silk useless. She is helping Grand Mother Silk bring about the Haunting to Bellhart. <br><br>Defeating her grants the player the <span>Needolin</span>, which allows Hornet to play songs in her needle with her silk.
