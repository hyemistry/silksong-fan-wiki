        <p>Silksong's second major patch (1.0.28650) is now available for players on all platforms.<br><br>Where the first patch dealt mainly with critical issues, this next one focuses on a few still remaining, while also cleaning up some bugs around specific tools.<br><br>For our upcoming patches, beyond regular fixes, our first priority remains to improve Silksong’s Simplified Chinese translation. A new script, by a well-regarded team, is already well underway. We’re expecting this new translation to be delivered in 3-4 weeks, with implementation to follow immediately after.<br><br>In the meantime, for Simplified Chinese players, we’ve recently been informed that a talented group of Hollow Knight fans has already produced their own full-translation mod for Silksong! We’ve heard good things about the mod, and players may want to consider shifting over to it.<br><br>Patch Notes<br>
- Added Dithering effect option in Advanced video settings (PC only). Reduces colour banding but can slightly soften the appearance of foreground assets. Defaults to 'Off'. <br>
- Updated Herald's Wish achievement description to clarify that players must both complete the wish and finish the game. <br>
- Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava. <br>
- Fixed rare cases of Shrine Guardian Seth getting out of bounds during battle. <br>
- Fixed rare case of Second Sentinel knocking the player out of bounds during battle. <br>
- Added catch to prevent Lugoli sometimes flying off screen and not returning during battle. <br>
- Further reduced chance of Silk Snippers getting stuck out of bounds in Chapel of the Reaper battle. <br>
- Fixed various instances of dying to bosses while killing them causing death sequences to play messily or out of sync. <br>
- Fixed Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock. <br>
- Cocoon positions in some locations updated to prevent it spawning in inaccessible areas. <br>
- Fixed Liquid Lacquer courier delivery not being accessible in Steel Soul mode. <br>
- Fixed some NPCs not correctly playing cursed hint dialogues in certain instances. <br>
- Fixed Pondcatcher Reed not being able to fly away after singing. <br>
- Fixed Verdania memory orbs sometimes replaying layered screen-edge burst effects. <br>
- Fixed the break counter not working for certain multihitter tools eg Conchcutter. <br>
- Fixed Volt Filament damage multiplier not applying for certain Silk Skills. <br>
- Fixed Cogflies and Wisps inappropriately targeting Skullwings. <br>
- Fixed Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change. <br>
- Fixed Curveclaw always breaking on the first hit after being deflected. <br>
- Fixed Plasmium Phial and Flea Brew sometimes not restoring as intended at benches. <br>
- Various other smaller tweaks and fixes. <br><br>

All fixes will apply retroactively, so players who've hit a significant bug that prevents progress should now be able to proceed. <br><br>

Further fixes are currently being worked on for a third patch, with some additional focus around improving controller support on PC platforms. Expect this one to come a little later, as we’re aiming to cover as many remaining issues as possible. <br><br>

As with previous patches, interim versions will be available to trial for Steam and GOG players via the public-beta branches on each platform.</p>
